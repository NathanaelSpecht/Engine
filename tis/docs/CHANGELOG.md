# TIS Changelog

Date: 2022 September 12
Completed version: 0.2
In development: Version 0.3

Version 0.1:
- [x] Build system that works on Linux and Windows, is easy to understand, and 
does not rely on any IDE.
- [x] Documentation that is easy to understand and does not overpromise.
- [x] License.

Version 0.2:
- [x] String functions that are easier to use than the ones in `string.h`. Is 
meant to replace the c standard library's `string.h`, but can be used alongside 
it, because there are no name collisions.
- [x] Conversion functions for string-to-type and type-to-string conversion, 
and is-type functions to check if a string-to-type conversion will succeed.
- [x] File function wrappers around some of the c standard library's `stdio.h`.

Version 0.3:
- [ ] Vector and matrix operations in 2d and 3d.
- [ ] 2D Rendering functions for text and sprite animations.

Version 0.4:
- [ ] Music function wrappers around SDL's audio functions, and math operations 
needed for music processing.

Version 0.5:
- [ ] 2D world, scene, object, hitbox, entity, and vehicle modeling. 2D model 
of the game world, disparate from the process used to render it.

Future Versions:
- [ ] Network function wrappers around the network sockets.
- [ ] 3D rendering functions for textured polygon meshes and 3D animations.
- [ ] 3D world, scene, object, hitbox, entity, and vehicle modeling. 3D model 
of the game world, disparate from the process used to render it.
