# TreesInSpaceEngine ("libTIS" or "TIS")

Hello! 
My name is Nathan Specht. I'm the founder of Trees in Space.
This is the engine we use at Trees in Space for game development.

If you're looking for API or modding information, check the docs folder.

Installation instructions are in INSTALL.md

The current version and its changes can be found in CHANGELOG.md

# Road To 1.0

My progress towards version 1.0 is in TODO.md. 
***Until version 1.0, expect breaking changes to the API from time to time.***

# 1.0 And Beyond

On release of version 1.0, TIS will be two things:

- A sprite-based game engine for games with a 3d world.

- A game design and modeling tool for making such games.

Updates after version 1.0 will continue to provide bug fixes, features, and performance improvements. 
API changes will be backwards compatible from this point onward, unless explicitly stated in the changelog.

# Links

This project and its documentation will always be free and public domain.
If you wish to support continued development of TIS, feel free to donate on Patreon here (***TODO link***).

The included graphics, music, and sounds are royalty free.
I obtained them from here:

- ***TODO cite sources when there are files to cite sources for.***
