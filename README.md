# TreesInSpaceEngine ("libTIS" or "TIS")

Hello and welcome to Trees in Space!
This is the engine and design tool we use for game development.

If you're looking for API documentation, check the docs folder.

Installation instructions are in INSTALL.md

The current version and its changes can be found in CHANGELOG.md

# Road To 1.0

Our progress towards version 1.0 is in TODO.md. 
***Until version 1.0, expect breaking changes to the API from time to time.***

# 1.0 And Beyond

On release of version 1.0, TIS will be:
- A sprite-based game engine for games with a 3d world.
- A game design and modeling tool for making such games.

Updates after version 1.0 will continue to provide bug fixes, features, and performance improvements. 
API changes will be backwards compatible from this point onward, unless explicitly stated in the changelog.
