# Engine

(ng) lovingly referred to as "engie".

These are the functions I use as the starting point for my programs.

Documentation:
- `ng/ng.h`: Engine API.
- `INSTALL.md`: Compile instructions and dependency list.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: The current version and changelog.

Licenses:
- The `LICENSE` file applies to:
	- `main.c`,
	- Engine's source files in the `ng/` folder,
	- The included game's source files in the `src/` folder.
- SDL2's files and license are in the `sdl2/` folder.
- Image files and their licenses are in the `art/` folder.
- Audio files and their licenses are in the `music/` folder.

Engine will always be free and open source.
