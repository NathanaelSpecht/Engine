# TreesInSpaceEngine

Hello. 
My name is Nathan Specht. 
This is the game engine I'm making for my game studio, Trees in Space. 
You can check out Trees in Space here:

This project will always be free and open source.

# Release

On release, TreesInSpaceEngine will be two things:

- A sprite-based game engine for games with a 3d world.

- A game design and modeling tool for making such games.

You can view my progress towards release in TODO.md. 
Until that checklist is complete, expect breaking changes from time to time.

# Updates After First Release

Updates after first release will continue to provide bug fixes, features, and performance improvements. 
Unless explicitly stated in the CHANGELOG.md, API changes shall be backwards compatible from this point onward.
