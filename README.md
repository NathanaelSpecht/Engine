# TreesInSpaceEngine

Hello! 
My name is Nathan Specht. 
This is the game engine I'm making for my game studio, Trees in Space.

If you're looking for API documentation, check the docs folder.

Installation instructions are in INSTALL.md

The current version its changes can be found in CHANGELOG.md

My progress towards version 1.0 is in TODO.md. ***Until version 1.0, expect breaking changes to the API from time to time.***

# Road To 1.0

On release of version 1.0, TreesInSpaceEngine will be two things:

- A sprite-based game engine for games with a 3d world.

- A game design and modeling tool for making such games.

# 1.0 And Beyond

Updates after version 1.0 will continue to provide bug fixes, features, and performance improvements. 
API changes will be backwards compatible from this point onward, unless explicitly stated in the changelog.

# Links
