# TreesInSpaceEngine (TIS)

Hello! 
My name is Nathan Specht. 
This is the game engine I'm making for my game studio, Trees in Space.

If you're looking for API documentation, check the docs folder. ***TODO add docs folder.***

Installation instructions are in INSTALL.md

The current version and its changes can be found in CHANGELOG.md

# Road To 1.0

My progress towards version 1.0 is in TODO.md. 
***Until version 1.0, expect breaking changes to the API from time to time.***

# 1.0 And Beyond

On release of version 1.0, TIS will be two things:

- A sprite-based game engine for games with a 3d world.

- A game design and modeling tool for making such games.

Updates after version 1.0 will continue to provide bug fixes, features, and performance improvements. 
API changes will be backwards compatible from this point onward, unless explicitly stated in the changelog.

# Links

This project will always be free and open source.
If you wish to support continued development of TIS, feel free to donate on Patreon here (***TODO link***).

The included test files, graphics, music, and sounds are free and copyright free.
I obtained them from here:

- ***TODO cite sources when there are files to cite sources for.***
