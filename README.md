# TreesInSpaceEngine (TIS)

Hello and welcome to Trees in Space!
This is my game engine.

If you're looking for API documentation, check the docs folder.

Installation instructions are in INSTALL.md.

The current major version and its major changes can be found in CHANGELOG.md.
Check the git log for a detailed list of changes.

# Road To 1.0 and Beyond

My progress towards version 1.0 is in TODO.md. 
***Until version 1.0, expect breaking changes to the API from time to time.***

My plan is for TIS to be a set of functions anyone can include in their C program to turn it into a functioning game.

Updates after version 1.0 will continue to provide bug fixes, features, and performance improvements. 
API changes will be backwards compatible from this point onward, unless explicitly stated in the changelog.
