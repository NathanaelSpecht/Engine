# TreesInSpaceEngine (TIS)

Hello and welcome to Trees in Space!
This is my game engine.
Well, the functions needed to get one working at least.

If you're looking for API documentation, check the `docs` folder.

Installation instructions are in `docs/INSTALL.md`.

The current version and its major changes can be found in 
`docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
Check the git log for a detailed list of changes.

# Road To 1.0 and Beyond

My progress towards version 1.0 is in `docs/TODO.md`. 
***Until version 1.0, expect breaking changes to the API from time to time.***

My plan is for TIS to be a set of functions anyone can include in their C 
program to turn it into a functioning game.

Updates after version 1.0 will continue to provide bug fixes, features, and 
performance improvements. 
API changes will be backwards compatible from 1.0 onward, unless 
explicitly stated in the changelog.
