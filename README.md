# Engine

Lovingly referred to as "engie" (ng).

This is the code I use as the starting point for my programs.
The included Fire Days game demonstrates how to use engie.

Documentation:
- `ng/ng.h`: Engie's API.
- `INSTALL.md`: Compile instructions and dependency list.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: The current version and changelog.

Licenses:
- The `LICENSE` file applies to:
	- The `Makefile`,
	- Engie's source files in the `ng/` folder,
	- Engie's documentation: `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
	- Fire Days's source files: `main.c`, and the `src/` folder,
	- Fire Days's graphics files in the `art/` folder.
- Fire Days's audio files and their licenses are in the `music/` folder.
- SDL2's files and license are in the `sdl/` folder.

Engie will always be free and open source.
