# TreesInSpaceEngine
Hello. My name is Nathan Specht. This is the game engine I'm making for my game studio, Trees in Space. You can check out Trees in Space here:

- (TODO: provide links to Steam, Twitter, etc. here)


On release, this engine will be standalone software that can become a game when given a description of a game and some game assets. Updates after first release will provide bug fixes and add more features and performance improvements until I'm satisfied.


This project will always be free and open source.
